# Bioinfo-Toolkit

## Description

This is a collection of useful scripts to analyse and format popular bioinformatic files, mainly dealing with NGS.

## Scripts

* **get_pairs**: separates paired reads and singletons from two paired fastq files (left and right)
* **generSampleFastx**: 2 scripts to generate sample files from fasta or fastq input files
* **fastaNameFilter**: filter the sequences in a fasta file given a string to find in the headers, or a file with all the ids
* **fastqNameFilter**: filter the reads in a fastq file given a string to find in the headers 
* **atomicblastplus**: submit a massively parallel Blast+ job-array to a computer cluster running on Oracle Grid Engine (previously Sun Grid Engine)
